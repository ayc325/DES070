                <p> Finish, done, and complete seems so easy to say when 
                    talking about class assignments or any progressable work. Reality is, 
                    nothing is finished and nothing will ever be complete or done right. 
                    Humans are constantly evolving and coming up with new ways to improve themselves, 
                    past works, and creations. They're constantly given chances and this leads 
                    to nothing ever being finished. Some “never-finished” people that are to be 
                    spoken of include students, athletes, scientists, writers, and web designers.
                <br><br>
                    <span class = "student" style="font-weight:bold;">Students</span> <span class = "studentStudy"><img src="images/student-studying.gif" width = "500px"></span>usually “complete” an assignment, but is it really complete? Going back and 
                    editing it, referring back to the assignment for other assignments, or using it to study 
                    can all be ways to show that nothing is ever “finished.” Students are never finished.
                <br><br>
                    <span class = "athlete" style = "font-weight:bold;">Athletes</span> <span class = "run"><img src = "images/run.gif"></span> may finish a race but they're always seeking improvement and striving 
                    for their ultimate best. On this note, if an athlete is striving for their best and 
                    reaching their limits, are there even limits? Athletes are never finished.
                <br><br> 
                    <span class = "scientist" style = "font-weight:bold;">Scientists</span> <span class = "research"><img src = "images/giphy.gif"></span>have learned so much and have met several milestones, yet they are still striving to reach higher and further 
                    to discover more. Scientists are never finished. In fact, this story here doesn't have an end. It keeps going endlessly 
                    with surprises and other people's work. With every author writing several works of writing, if they were all connected 
                    to each other, one's writing is never finished.
            <br><br>
                    Web Design is another industry where nothing is ever finished. Although <span class = "webdesigner" style = "font-weight:bold;">web designers</span><span class = "coding"><img src = "images/coding.gif" width = "500px"></span> who code 
                    using HTML and CSS are on the dying side, web designers will always be needed. No single web 
                    project is ever finished in the real world. Web designers continue to manage and maintain the 
                    websites and webpages for their personal sites, companies, institutions, and organizations. 
                    Web designers are never finished.
           <br><br>
                    As seen here, there are occupations with tasks, duties and responsibilities that will never 
                    be complete. These are just a few, and there are many more out there. Although small tasks may 
                    be “finished,” long term, “finishing” is just a concept that we humans try to embed in our heads 
                    to give ourselves a sense of accomplishment and pleasure.
